            <h3>Queensborough Community College</h3>
            <h2>Digital Art and Design</h2>
            <h4>Degree: A.S.</h4>
            <p>The A.S. degree program in Digital Art and Design is structured to prepare students to enter the greatly expanding field of new media, a field which has been revolutionized in the last 20 years with the advent of computer graphics programs. In addition to four basic courses that provide a solid background in art, students take five courses in digital art and design, which develop computer skills for fine and applied arts. A required course in the History of Graphic Design gives students an overview of graphic design in historical context. A suggested Art History elective provides a broad knowledge of art in general. With this preparation, students will be able to design for industry.<span class="orange-color">Digital Art and Design students should take ARTS-192 and ET-710 as Writing Intensive course requirements.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                Specifically, the program provides students with:
                <li>knowledge of current widely used programs in the design field</li>
                <li>proficiency in operating these programs</li>
                <li>understanding of the means and methods of mass (production of artwork using these programs)</li>
                <li>skills for working with and understanding the computer and the technical problems associated with operating a computer</li>
                <li>knowledge based on awareness of the importance of aesthetic judgment in making design decisions.</li>
            </p>
            <h4>Transfer Options</h4>
            <p> BMCC has articulation agreements with CUNY NYC College of Technology to allow you to seamlessly continue your education there without any loss of credits. </p>
